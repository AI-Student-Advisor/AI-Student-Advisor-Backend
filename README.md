# AI Student Advisor

A virtual companion for navigating the complexities of higher education.

Engage in insightful conversations with our conversational AI agent to receive personalized guidance on a wide array of topicsâ€”from choosing the right degree programs to selecting courses that align with your academic goals. Whether you're a prospective student exploring options or a current student seeking advice, **AI Student Advisor** is here to provide instant and tailored assistance.

## How it works?

AI Student Advisor is a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based conversational AI agent. Essentially, it a chat application with two primary components: **retrieval** and **generation**. The retrieval component is responsible for finding the most relevant information from a large corpus of documents, which we call the **context**. The generation component is then responsible for interacting with an external LLM (Large Language Model) to generate a response by providing it with the user query and the retrieved context. The generated response is then returned to the user.
